The first part of this file makes sure you can negate quantified statements
in your head without the help of `push_neg`.

You need to complete the statement and then use the `check_me` tactic
to check your answer. This tactic exists only for those exercises,
it mostly calls `push_neg` and then cleans up a bit.

`def SeqLimit (u : ℕ → ℝ) (l : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |u n - l| ≤ ε`

-- In this section, u denotes a sequence of real numbers
-- f is a function from ℝ to ℝ
-- x₀ and l are real numbers
variable (u : ℕ → ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (x₀ l : ℝ)

In the next exercise, we need to keep in mind that
`∀ x x', ...` is the abbreviation of
`∀ x, ∀ x', ... `.

Also, `∃ x x', ...` is the abbreviation of `∃ x, ∃ x', ...`.

We now turn to elementary applications of negations to limits of sequences.
Remember that `linarith` can find easy numerical contradictions.

Also recall the following lemmas:

`abs_le {x y : ℝ} : |x| ≤ y ↔ -y ≤ x ∧ x ≤ y`

`ge_max_iff (p q r) : r ≥ max p q  ↔ r ≥ p ∧ r ≥ q`

`le_max_left p q : p ≤ max p q`

`le_max_right p q : q ≤ max p q`

In the following exercises, `A : set ℝ` means that A is a set of real numbers.
We can use the usual notation `x ∈ A`.

The notation `∀ x ∈ A, ...` is the abbreviation of `∀ x, x ∈ A → ... `

The notation `∃ x ∈ A, ...` is the abbreviation of `∃ x, x ∈ A ∧ ... `.

We'll work with upper bounds and supremums.
Again we'll introduce specialized definitions for the sake of exercises, but mathlib
has more general versions.

`def UpperBound (A : set ℝ) (x : ℝ) := ∀ a ∈ A, a ≤ x`

`def IsSup (A : set ℝ) (x : ℝ) := UpperBound A x ∧ ∀ y, UpperBound A y → x ≤ y`


Remark: one can easily show that a set of real numbers has at most one sup,
but we won't need this.

Let's do a variation on an example from file 07 that will be useful in the last
exercise below.
